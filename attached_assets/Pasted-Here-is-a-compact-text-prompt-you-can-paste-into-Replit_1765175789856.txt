You are an expert Next.js + TypeScript + creative front-end engineer. Build a **personal portfolio website** for a single developer with the following exact requirements.

1. TECH STACK

* Next.js (latest, **App Router**) with **TypeScript**
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling
* **Framer Motion** for UI animations
* **three.js** (prefer `@react-three/fiber` + `@react-three/drei`) for 3D
* **barba.js** for page/route transitions
* Basic contact form using React Hook Form (client-side validation only, just console.log on submit)
* Setup ESLint + Prettier with standard React/Next rules

2. THEME & STYLE (GEN-Z DARK RAVE)

* Dark-only UI, no light mode
* Background: near-black with subtle noise texture
* Neon accent colors: electric purple, magenta, cyan, acid green
* Use glowing outlines, gradients, and chromatic aberration-inspired effects
* Typography: bold headline font + clean sans-serif for body
* Overall feel: futuristic rave / cyberpunk club dashboard, but readable and not overdone

3. ROUTES (APP ROUTER)
   Use the App Router in `app/` with these pages:

* `/` – Hero / Landing
* `/about` – About & Skills
* `/experience` – Work & Education timeline
* `/projects` – Projects gallery (+ optional dynamic route `/projects/[slug]`)
* `/playground` – Interactive / experimental page
* `/contact` – Contact form + social links

Include a **global layout** (`app/layout.tsx`) with:

* Fixed top **navbar** (logo/monogram + links to all routes + “Let’s Talk” button to `/contact`)
* Subtle footer (copyright + small note)
* Global background + noise texture + rave theme styles

4. DATA-DRIVEN CONTENT (CENTRALIZED, TYPED)
   Create a `data/` folder with TypeScript data files and types. Dummy content but clearly marked placeholders like `YOUR_NAME`, `YOUR_TITLE`, etc.

* `data/profile.ts`

  ```ts
  export type Profile = {
    name: string;
    tagline: string;
    location: string;
    shortBio: string;
    profileImage: string; // path or URL
  };
  ```
* `data/skills.ts`

  ```ts
  export type SkillGroup = {
    category: string;
    skills: { name: string; level: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced" | "expert" }[];
  };
  ```
* `data/experience.ts`

  ```ts
  export type ExperienceItem = {
    type: "work" | "education";
    roleOrDegree: string;
    companyOrSchool: string;
    location: string;
    startDate: string;
    endDate: string | "Present";
    description: string;
    technologies: string[];
  };
  ```
* `data/projects.ts`

  ```ts
  export type Project = {
    title: string;
    slug: string;
    shortDescription: string;
    longDescription: string;
    techStack: string[];
    githubUrl?: string;
    liveUrl?: string;
    highlight: boolean;
    thumbnail: string;
  };
  ```
* `data/socials.ts`

  ```ts
  export type SocialLink = {
    label: string;
    url: string;
    icon?: string; // name or id, can be used with an icon set
  };
  ```

All pages must consume data from these files (no hardcoded profile/skills/experience/projects directly in components).

5. LAYOUT & COMPONENT STRUCTURE
   Use a clean folder structure like:

* `app/` – routes and page-level components
* `components/ui/` – buttons, cards, chips, etc.
* `components/layout/` – navbar, footer, page transition overlay
* `components/3d/` – all three.js / R3F scenes
* `data/` – data files
* `lib/` – helpers (e.g., barba.js integration, constants, theme tokens)

Create reusable components:

* Neon button (hover: glow + slight scale)
* Card component (used for projects, experience items, etc.)
* Section wrapper with animated heading and Framer Motion entrance
* Tech badge / pill component with hover glow

6. THREE.JS / 3D REQUIREMENTS

* Hero 3D scene component (e.g. `HeroScene.tsx`) using R3F + drei:

  * A simple rotating neon object (sphere/cube/abstract) with emissive material
  * Subtle camera movement
  * Ensure SSR safety by lazy-loading / client-only usage
* Optional background particles or a simple animated grid in a separate, lightweight scene
* Provide a graceful fallback (e.g., static gradient background) if WebGL is unavailable

7. PAGE CONTENT & ANIMATIONS

**`/` (Landing / Hero)**

* Left:

  * Large name (`YOUR_NAME`)
  * Role/title (`YOUR_TITLE` like “Full-Stack Developer & Creative Coder”)
  * 1–2 line pitch
  * Primary CTA: View Projects (`/projects`)
  * Secondary CTA: Contact Me (`/contact`)
* Right or background: Hero 3D scene
* Use Framer Motion to animate hero text + buttons on mount (staggered entrance).

**`/about` (About & Skills)**

* About section: short bio, what you do, interests, etc. (from `profile.ts`)
* Skills section:

  * Render groups from `skills.ts` using tabs or filters (“Frontend”, “Backend”, “Tools”, etc.)
  * Visual representation: grid of glowing pills or simple skill bars with neon accent
* Use scroll-based reveal animations for sections.

**`/experience` (Work & Education Timeline)**

* Vertical timeline separated into Work and Education (filter buttons or headers)
* Each item from `experience.ts` rendered as a card attached to a neon line
* Animate items in as user scrolls (staggered).

**`/projects` (Projects Gallery)**

* Grid of project cards using `projects.ts` data
* Each card: thumbnail, title, short description, tech stack pills
* Hover state: slight scale, increased glow, show actions (“View Details”, “GitHub”, “Live”)
* Implement optional dynamic route `/projects/[slug]` to show long description, full tech stack, and links.

**`/playground` (Interactive / Experimental)**

* 1–3 small interactive visual demos (e.g., small 3D toy, shader-like pattern, or pointer-reactive canvas)
* Keep performance acceptable and don’t block the whole app.

**`/contact` (Contact Form + Socials)**

* Contact form fields: name, email, message
* Use React Hook Form + basic validation (required fields, simple email check)
* On submit: `console.log` the data and show a “Message sent” success state (no backend).
* Render social links from `socials.ts` as neon pills or icons with hover animation.

8. ANIMATION & TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS

Use **Framer Motion** for:

* Page section entrances (fade+slide, with small stagger)
* Hover/tap states on buttons, nav links, cards (scale, glow, slight rotation)
* Scroll-triggered reveals for sections (e.g., skills, experience, projects)

Use **barba.js** for:

* Route transitions between pages:

  * On navigation, play an **out** animation on current page (content fades/slides, overlay appears)
  * Then play an **in** animation for the new page (overlay hides, content reveals)
* Implement a full-screen transition overlay component in `components/layout` and coordinate it with Next.js router events.
* Keep transitions short (~0.4–0.8s) and ensure it fails gracefully if JS is disabled or barba fails.

9. RESPONSIVENESS & PERFORMANCE

* Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop):

  * Stack sections vertically on mobile, split layout on larger screens.
* Optimize:

  * Lazy-load 3D components
  * Use Tailwind utilities for spacing and layout
  * Avoid unnecessary re-renders; keep three.js scenes as lightweight as possible

10. CODE QUALITY

* Strong TypeScript usage (avoid `any`)
* No unused imports or dead code
* Clean, modular components
* Use constants for theme (colors, animation durations, easing) in a small config file in `lib/`.

Deliver a complete, runnable Next.js + TypeScript project that matches all of the above: a **Gen-Z dark rave themed**, fully animated, 3D-enhanced, multi-page portfolio ready for me to customize by editing the `data/` files.
